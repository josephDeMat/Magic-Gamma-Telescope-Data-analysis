Magic Gamma Telescope Data analysis

The Magic Gamma Telescope dataset contains data that is a simulation of registration of high energy particles picked up by a ground-based Cherenkov telescope. I used this dataset to build a model that can differentiate and classify between particles that are picked up by the telescopeâ€™s sensor. These particles are gammas(signal) and hadronic showers(background).
